Key Modifications:

Use %matplotlib tk magic command to enable tkinter event loops within Jupyter Notebook.
Run the tkinter event loop in a separate thread to prevent Jupyter from freezing, as Jupyter expects to regain control after each cell execution.


Key Changes:
threading.Thread(target=run_tkinter_in_thread).start(): This runs the tkinter event loop in a separate thread, allowing Jupyter to stay responsive.
All the tkinter GUI code is wrapped inside the function run_tkinter_in_thread(), which is executed in a thread.


How to Run in Jupyter Notebook:

Open Jupyter Notebook.
Run the entire code in a single cell.
The GUI window should pop up separately, allowing you to start and stop voice recording.
The voice recording will still save to output.wav in the current working directory.
