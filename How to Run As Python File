AS PYTHON FILE
How It Works:

Recording Setup:
The sounddevice library records audio using the system's microphone at the specified sample rate (fs) and for a specified duration.
The audio is saved in a file named output.wav using wavio.

Tkinter GUI:
The GUI allows you to start and stop recording using buttons.
You can adjust the recording duration using a slider.

Multi-threading:
To ensure the GUI doesn't freeze while recording, a new thread is created to handle the recording process.

How to Run:
Make sure you have the required libraries installed (sounddevice, wavio, and tkinter comes pre-installed with Python).
Run the script, and you'll see a simple window where you can start and stop the voice recording.
The recording will be saved as output.wav in the same directory as your script.
